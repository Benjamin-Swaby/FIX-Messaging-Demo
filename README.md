# FIX Messaging Demo
-----
This project is a web app that will let a user perform different operations.

The site will then display the FIX message sent to the exchange and the response from the exchange.


**NOTE:** The exchange will simulate every order being half filled for demonstrative purposes. There is no matching engine.
